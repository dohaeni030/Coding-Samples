# Synthetic 2D Suspended Sediment Concentration (SSC) Modeling
This project creates a synthetic suspended sediment concentration (SSC) field
using a Gaussian plume model and reconstructs the field from sparse sensor
measurements.  
The workflow includes plume generation, sensor simulation with noise/missing
data, RBF-based spatial interpolation, and reconstruction evaluation
(RMSE, MAE).  
This script is designed to demonstrate numerical modeling and spatial
reconstruction techniques, not a full hydrodynamic model.
